    <h1>Appearance</h1>
    <article>
    <p> 
        Clownfish, frequently referred to as anemonefish, are readily identifiable by their characteristic appearance:
    </p>

    <h2> Colouring:</h2>
    <p>
        Usually, they have three separate white stripes that run horizontally across the backs of their outstanding orange bodies. In their underwater habitat, these horizontal lines stand out because of their prominent contrast to their vivid orange or yellow bodies. However, certain species may have colour variations, such as spots of black, white, or yellow.

    <h2> Dimensions: </h2>
    <p>    
       Mature clownfish range in length from 2 to 5 inches (5 to 13 centimetres), depending upon the species. That renders these rather small fish. In a few species, there are more obvious size inequalities between each gender, with females frequently measuring greater than males.Fin Framework: Clownfish have distinctively arched fins that are typically pointed out in black or white. For equilibrium, control, and propellers, these fins—which are extremely tiny in relation to their overall size—are crucial.
    </p>    

    <h2>Head and eyes: </h2>
    <p>
        Clownfish are marine and have microscopic jaws that are outfitted with rows of tiny, comb-like teeth that have been created to assist them in eating small prey. They are capable of identifying predators as well as victims with a wide range of vision because of the size and position of their eyes on the backs of their heads.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Behavioural Changes:</h2>
    <p>
         Clownfish can look for sanctuary within the body of the host anemone's petals in the event of a threat. When not exhibiting aggressive behaviour, they protect the surrounding habitat from other clownfish and visitors.</p>
